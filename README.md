Consider, StrideSphere is a manufacturer of treadmills and their market research team wants to gain insights on what their target audience really looks like for each of their models so they can make better recommendations for potential customers. The team in doing so will examine customer profiles, seeking differences and similarities in customer characteristics across the product line.

We will also perform descriptive analytics to help build profiles for each StrideSphere treadmill model. The team will sift through relevant tables and visualizations (two way contingency tables, in addition) to study important trends. Moreover, marginal and conditional probabilities will be calculated to reveal verifiable insights and implications for business strategy.

StrideSphere Treadmill Portfolio:

- KP281: Entry-level treadmill; $1,500

- KP481: $1,750 mid-range treadmill for moderate runners.

- KP781: Flagship treadmill with premium features, $2,500

The aim of this project is to gather actionable insights that will help StrideSphere better align their treadmill products with what their customers want and need.
